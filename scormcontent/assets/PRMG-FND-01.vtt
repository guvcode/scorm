<v ->Project management involves planning,</v>

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.570
execution, and monitoring projects.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.820
Software developers use project management

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.130
to engineer new product features.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.360
Construction firms use it

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640
throughout the construction of new buildings.

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.410
And marketing teams need it to launch new campaigns.

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.050
In this video, you'll learn exactly

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.130
what project management entails

10
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.323
along with its three constraints.

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.290
A project is a temporary endeavor

12
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.790
designed to create a specific product, service, or outcome.

13
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.610
You can break this definition down

14
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
into three key characteristics that define a project.

15
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.030
First, a project is goal-oriented.

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.140
It has a specific objective or outcome

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.400
it's designed to achieve.

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.770
Second, a project is temporary.

19
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.830
It has a finite start and end date.

20
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.840
And third, a project is unique.

21
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.390
A project has its own unique goals.

22
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.830
It's not an ongoing or regular business operation.

23
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.720
Now imagine that your boss gives you a new project.

24
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.800
She wants you to create

25
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.130
a new downloadable ebook for your customers.

26
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.750
Where would you start?

27
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520
What steps are involved?

28
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.050
And do you need the support of designers,

29
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.010
writers, or other resources?

30
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.413
These are all questions that relate to project management.

31
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.740
Project management is the initiation,

32
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.350
planning, execution, monitoring, and closure of a project.

33
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.910
Project managers take ownership of a project

34
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.320
and are accountable for its success.

35
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.870
They provide project leadership and direction,

36
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.110
manager resources, and break down

37
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.300
a big objective into small, actionable tasks.

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.380
Not only is a project manager expected to lead their team

39
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.090
to deliver a project successfully,

40
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.870
but they also must work within three constraints.

41
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.950
The three constraints of project management

42
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.020
are time, cost, and scope.

43
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320
Time refers to the specific duration of time

44
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.710
allotted to complete the project.

45
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.490
Cost is the budget allocated for a project.

46
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.130
And a project scope refers to the tasks,

47
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.010
features, or deliverables involved in a project.

48
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.100
Time, cost, and scope are interdependent.

49
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.130
Changing one constraint will affect others.

50
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.820
If you reduce the cost or budget of the project,

51
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.840
then you might increase the scope.

52
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.030
If you inflate the scope of a project,

53
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.180
then the project may demand more time.

54
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.740
As you can see, effective project management

55
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.040
is critical in every business.

56
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.250
Projects are important for creating new initiatives

57
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.070
that solve business problems

58
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.890
or take advantage of business opportunities.

59
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.780
And project management is important

60
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.653
for delivering on project goals.
