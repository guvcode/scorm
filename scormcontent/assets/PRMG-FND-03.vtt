00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.320
<v ->There are a limited number of projects</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.300
a company can take on at any given time.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.720
Executive management must decide what projects to prioritize

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.973
and how to use company resources most effectively.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.350
A business case is the key document used

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.210
for making these kinds of decisions.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.750
It establishes the purpose of a project

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.563
and weighs the project's benefits and costs.

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.570
A business case argues why a project is needed

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.040
and ideally, it describes how a project

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.970
solves a problem for the business.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.220
It's an important step in making sure a project

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.490
is a profitable use of business resources.

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.363
But how do you write one?

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040
Let's break down the seven steps

16
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.070
for developing a strong business case.

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.310
A business case should begin with an executive summary.

18
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.670
An executive summary is

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360
a high-level overview of the project.

20
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.620
It summarizes the most important takeaways

21
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.800
of everything that follows in the business case.

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.810
That's why some people find it helpful

23
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.063
to write the executive summary last.

24
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.740
Since an executive summary is a high-level overview

25
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.520
of everything that follows,

26
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.283
let's review the other components of a business case.

27
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.270
The next section of a business case

28
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.440
is the problem statement.

29
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600
The problem statement is a short description

30
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.510
of the business problem that the project solves.

31
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.410
Or sometimes it might actually be an opportunity

32
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.850
that the project is designed to capitalize on.

33
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.210
Your problem statement doesn't need

34
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.590
to be long or complicated.

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.160
The problem should be specific

36
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.693
and significant to the company's interest or needs.

37
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.890
Third, is to give possible solutions.

38
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.950
Provide executive management with a list of

39
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.020
alternative solutions to the problem statement.

40
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.720
This will demonstrate that you've considered

41
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.680
all of the options.

42
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.070
In the next section, you'll outline the proposed solution,

43
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.610
which is the project itself.

44
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.320
Now you're ready to describe the proposed project

45
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.523
and persuade executive management of it's benefits.

46
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.930
What is your proposed solution?

47
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.130
What are the expected outcomes?

48
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
And why is this option better than the others?

49
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.130
Provide a clear description of the project

50
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.250
you're suggesting, followed by both the qualitative

51
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.543
and quantitative benefits it offers for the business.

52
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.920
For example, you might predict an increase

53
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.050
in conversion rates by 13% but you also might explain

54
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.360
how the project will position your company

55
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.253
as an expert in the industry.

56
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600
While you need to present your project's benefits,

57
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.100
you also need to be transparent when identifying

58
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.423
the project's risk and limitations.

59
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.400
Develop an outline of risks or possible threats

60
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550
to the project's success.

61
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.300
You'll make a stronger business case

62
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.800
and foster confidence to an executive management

63
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.310
if you also include strategies for mitigating them.

64
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.610
So far you've established the project need

65
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.460
and proposed a solution.

66
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.930
Next, it's time to talk about the project logistics.

67
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.420
This means you need to breakdown

68
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.530
project costs and timelines.

69
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.690
Note that you aren't expected to know exactly

70
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.200
what a project will cost

71
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.100
or exactly how long a project will take.

72
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.340
However, you should do your research

73
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.093
and know enough to make a close estimation.

74
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.260
Executive management needs to know relatively

75
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.170
how much your project will cost

76
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.883
and how much time it will take to make an informed decision.

77
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.870
The final section of the business case

78
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.540
is a preliminary project plan

79
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.610
This is an overview of the project's key milestones,

80
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.070
workflow, scope, and resources.

81
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.100
Again, while you don't need to know every task involved

82
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.920
in executing a project,

83
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.900
you do need to highlight the key project milestones

84
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.700
and the general boundaries of the project.

85
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.610
What is or isn't included in the project deliverables.

86
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.640
So, there you have it.

87
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.470
Those are the seven main components

88
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.600
of an effective business case.

89
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.530
An executive summary, problem statement,

90
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.550
alternative options, an overview of your project

91
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.730
and it's benefits, project risks, cost,

92
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.600
and timeline, and a preliminary project plan.

93
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.030
Make your business case thorough, accurate,

94
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.430
and focused on solving a problem.

95
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.110
Not only will it increase your chances

96
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.950
of getting your project approved

97
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.330
but it will also do the legwork for

98
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.130
the project planning phase once you get the green light.
