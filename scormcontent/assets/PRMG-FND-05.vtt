00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.370
<v ->Project management isn't just about schedules,</v>

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.780
tasks and processes.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.200
People power successful projects.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.150
Project managers help to direct and organize a project,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.180
but they also rely on a team of people to execute it.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.120
That means it's especially important for project managers

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.700
to learn how to empower their project teams

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.620
and create strong results.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.640
In this video, we'll share seven strategies you can employ

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.530
to better support, lead and communicate

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.210
with your project team.

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.260
Use these strategies to set your team

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.120
and project up for success.

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.930
First, equip your team with the right resources

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.150
by choosing the right people.

16
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.280
Choose your project team based on the unique objectives,

17
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.320
tasks and skills or areas of expertise

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.360
required for the project.

19
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.280
Don't assume that the most senior employee

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.120
is best equipped for a project.

21
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.780
Instead, review your options carefully

22
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200
and choose people whose skills, expertise

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.570
and interests align most.

24
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.240
Don't forget to consider team members' availability

25
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.563
and bandwidth, too.

26
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.300
The second strategy is to communicate the vision

27
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.060
and greater mission of the project.

28
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
Always communicate why a task is important,

29
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.460
how it impacts the success of the project,

30
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.933
and how the project aligns with the company's bigger goals.

31
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.020
Motivate your team by keeping them connected

32
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.210
to the greater vision of the project

33
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.130
and how their role contributes meaningfully to that vision.

34
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.050
However, your goal is not just

35
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.027
to dictate the vision to your team.

36
00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:41.060
Get your team excited about your project's vision.

37
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.910
Aim to get your team's buy-in,

38
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.610
which leads to our third strategy.

39
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.020
The third strategy is to include your team

40
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.100
in important discussions.

41
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.540
Ideally you've selected your project team

42
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.210
based on the unique strengths, skill sets

43
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.020
and areas of expertise that they bring to the project.

44
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.940
Lean on their expertise.

45
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.580
Bring your team into discussions about planning,

46
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.780
execution and monitoring of the project.

47
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.630
They can bring awareness to individual scheduling risks

48
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.970
and weigh in on the best way to approach technical tasks.

49
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.630
You'll enhance team engagement, increase project buy-in,

50
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.403
and make more informed project decisions.

51
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.030
Fourth, empower your team with a clear communication plan.

52
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.710
You might set weekly team status meetings,

53
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.800
email check-ins, or biweekly one-on-one meetings.

54
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.330
No matter what you do, make sure to set clear, open

55
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.583
and consistent lines of communication.

56
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.270
Regular check-ins encourage your team

57
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.810
to communicate when problems arise,

58
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.550
ask for help when they need it, or tackle issues early on.

59
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.990
And a single repository for accessing project information

60
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.790
and documentation will prevent confusion

61
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.240
and give your team one source of truth.

62
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.910
Also, reporting regular progress updates

63
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.160
may even boost team accountability,

64
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.290
which is what the next strategy is all about.

65
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.683
The fifth strategy is to create team accountability.

66
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.160
Always assign responsibility

67
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.970
for a specific project task to one person.

68
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.640
If two people need to work on a task together,

69
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.740
assign one person to serve as the task lead

70
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.840
and take responsibility for its completion.

71
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.870
That will avoid any confusion or ambiguity

72
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.000
about task ownership.

73
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.570
And when you're discussing a task due date,

74
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.390
try to explain why that due date is important

75
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.860
and how it impacts the project's schedule

76
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.453
and the rest of the team.

77
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.540
The sixth strategy is to keep your team focused

78
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.540
on high-priority tasks and free them from unnecessary work.

79
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.690
While project managers often focus on delegating

80
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.560
and monitoring tasks,

81
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.003
this strategy focuses on removing them.

82
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.130
Actively track what each project team member is working on

83
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.323
for your project or others.

84
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.230
Identify low priority or less urgent tasks,

85
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.500
and postpone them or remove them

86
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.003
from the team member's plate.

87
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.600
The final strategy is to break down a project's objectives

88
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.373
and deadlines into a handful of main milestones.

89
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.440
Set deadlines for each milestone,

90
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.400
as well as the group of tasks within each milestone,

91
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.133
to create urgency and motivate your team.

92
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.900
Milestones will also help you monitor

93
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.240
for project issues or possible delays.

94
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.040
All together the project manager

95
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.970
needs to choose the right team, provide clear direction,

96
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.650
motivate and encourage the team, remove roadblocks,

97
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.950
facilitate effective communication,

98
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.710
create team accountability

99
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.220
and effectively manage team resources.

100
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.820
Take care of your team,

101
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.740
and your team will take care of the project.

102
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.610
Finally, don't forget to praise your team

103
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.760
for their hard work and smaller accomplishments

104
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.470
throughout the process.

105
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.853
A little recognition goes a long way.
