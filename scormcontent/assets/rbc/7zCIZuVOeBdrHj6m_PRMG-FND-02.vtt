<v ->The four phases of project management</v>

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.610
provide a framework for leading a project

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.310
from inception to delivery.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.010
The four phases answer questions

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.430
such as how do I get started?

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.620
What comes next?

7
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.460
And what steps should I take to move a project forward?

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.310
The phases give you and your team structure and clarity

9
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.710
for completing a project,

10
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.810
and provide a standardized process

11
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010
for reliably achieving project goals.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.300
The four phases of project management

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.290
are project initiation, planning,

14
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.370
execution and monitoring and closure.

15
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.190
We'll describe what each phase means

16
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.550
and give you one main tip for implementation.

17
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.650
The first phase is project initiation.

18
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.740
The initiation is everything that happens

19
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.940
before a project is approved.

20
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.540
It includes a project proposal,

21
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.540
and approval process by the client or executive management.

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.050
There are two key questions that determine

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.590
if a project will get approved or denied.

24
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.530
First, is the project feasible?

25
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.250
What are the project boundaries,

26
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.510
and do you have the resources required

27
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.640
to complete the project?

28
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.020
And second, is the project valuable?

29
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.383
Is it profitable financially or strategically?

30
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.240
The initiation phase involves conceptualizing a project

31
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.890
at a high level, determining its costs and benefits,

32
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.950
identifying its key stakeholders

33
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.170
and drafting a general project workflow

34
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.080
to help answer those two questions.

35
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.340
The biggest tip for the initiation phase

36
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.860
is to identify and clearly communicate a business problem

37
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
that the project will solve.

38
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340
Identify what the problem is.

39
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.360
Describe alternatives for solving it.

40
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.180
And explain why this project is the best option.

41
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.080
After a project gets the green light,

42
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.470
it moves into the planning phase.

43
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.040
The planning phase is incredibly important.

44
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.270
It creates the foundation for your project's execution,

45
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.770
and it involves breaking down the project goals

46
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.770
into smaller, more manageable action items called tasks.

47
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.890
You'll need to define the tasks necessary

48
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.870
to complete the project.

49
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.410
Determine who's responsible for them.

50
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.210
Put tasks in the order they need to happen.

51
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.350
Group tasks to form key project milestones,

52
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.590
and set deadlines for each task and milestone.

53
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.580
Our biggest tip for the planning phase

54
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.560
is to create a thorough project plan

55
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.780
that documents the project objectives,

56
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.060
deliverables, scope, budget and schedule of tasks.

57
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.170
Your project team should always have access

58
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730
to the project plan for reference and direction.

59
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.360
An official project kickoff meeting with your team

60
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.800
typically signals the transition between the planning phase

61
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.900
and the execution and monitoring phase, which is up next.

62
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.520
In this phase, project team members perform the tasks needed

63
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.490
to achieve project objectives

64
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.260
and create project deliverables.

65
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.670
At the same time, the project manager

66
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.400
monitors the team's progress, mitigates risks,

67
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.850
identifies and removes roadblocks

68
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.180
and directs any necessary changes

69
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.713
to meet the team's allotted cost, time and scope.

70
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.260
One tip for the execution and monitoring phase

71
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.370
is to create clear channels of communication.

72
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.170
Check in regularly with your team,

73
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.760
and encourage team members to share project setbacks.

74
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.440
That will help you prevent delays

75
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.170
and resolve issues early.

76
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.750
However, just because you've executed a project

77
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.990
doesn't mean that your work is over.

78
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.370
Let's move on to the fourth and final phase

79
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.510
of project management.

80
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.840
The final phase is the project's closure.

81
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.460
Closure occurs when you achieve your project goals

82
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.740
and deliver the final project to its intended client,

83
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.483
users or executive management.

84
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.380
Always double check

85
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.390
that you've fulfilled project requirements

86
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.550
and created all defined project deliverables

87
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.653
before signing off on a project.

88
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.960
A good practice while implementing this phase

89
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.520
is to conduct a debrief meeting with your team

90
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.210
to reflect on how the project went, evaluate performance

91
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.580
and identify opportunities to improve future projects.

92
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.710
All together, the four phases of project management

93
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.040
are initiation, planning,

94
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.280
execution and monitoring and closure.

95
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.370
Follow these phases in this order

96
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.530
to make sure you don't miss any key steps

97
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.563
in the project management process.
