00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.230
<v ->A Project Plan is a Project Manager's best defense</v>

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.810
against schedule delays, budget problems,

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.990
and unfulfilled requirements.

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.710
It's a formal document that defines what a project

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.800
will deliver, and how it will be executed.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.470
Executive management, or the client, must approve

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.670
the Project Plan before you start, ensuring that

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.350
everyone is on the same page.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.160
While you can expand or reduce your plan, depending

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.130
on the scope of the project, it's best not to scrimp

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.020
on a document that's meant to direct your Project Team,

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990
and ensure that all of the work gets done,

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.920
when it needs to.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
Five main sections comprise a strong Project Plan.

15
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.400
The first section is the Project overview.

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.540
This is just as it sounds.

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.730
It's a brief description of the project, and it includes

18
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.360
any relevant context, such as background information,

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.600
past initiatives, or why a project was initiated.

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.100
The Project overview gives a broad snapshot

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.910
of what the project is about, and the environment

22
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.213
in which it operates.

23
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.530
After the Project overview, the second step is to describe

24
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.973
the project Goals and deliverables.

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.040
Goals should give team members an understanding

26
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.160
of the client's objectives, and criteria for successful

27
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.623
project completion.

28
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.160
Deliverables are any tangible products or outputs

29
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.950
of the project, such as media files, blog posts,

30
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.563
and product features.

31
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.430
Make Project Goals and deliverables as specific

32
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.010
and measurable as possible.

33
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.960
So far, you've provided an overview of the project,

34
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.650
along with its goals and deliverables.

35
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.570
The next section is the bulk of your Project Plan,

36
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.970
where you introduce the logistics and details.

37
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.460
The next section is Implementation and scheduling.

38
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.320
It includes a process and work flow

39
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.950
for executing the project.

40
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.240
Define what tasks are necessary to achieve project goals

41
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.410
and group them into key milestones or phases.

42
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.300
Assign an individual team member

43
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.750
to take ownership of each task.

44
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.503
This is the person responsible for its completion.

45
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.840
Set deadlines, give specific due dates for individual tasks

46
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
and milestones, and organize all of this information

47
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.880
into a schedule that's visual and easy for the team

48
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.593
to see their responsibilities and deadlines.

49
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.070
The third section is Resource requirements.

50
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.430
Identify the resources you need to complete a project,

51
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.430
including time, people, budget and equipment or technology.

52
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.020
Where and how will you obtain these resources?

53
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.933
How will you distribute them across project phases?

54
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.323
The last section is Risk management and communication.

55
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.180
First, what are the potential risks, or a threat,

56
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.100
to the successful completion of the project?

57
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.070
Is it possible that you'll experience issues

58
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.820
with staffing, funding or supplies?

59
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.700
Identify the risks and define strategies

60
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.023
for mitigating them.

61
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.980
And second, what is your communication plan?

62
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.820
How will critical project information be delivered,

63
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.110
and at what frequency.

64
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.350
Setting clear, effective and open lines of communication

65
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.490
encourages your team to speak up when there's a problem,

66
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.610
and address it right away.

67
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.340
All together, these sections will help you create a plan

68
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.640
that is specific, actionable, and proactive.

69
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.710
Expect to do some research, and interview the client,

70
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.040
or key stakeholders, to gather the information

71
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.380
you need, but also remember that, no matter how thorough

72
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.890
your planning, plans can always change.

73
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.100
A Project Plan is not a fixed document to set aside

74
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.620
after it's approved.

75
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.080
Think of it as a living, breathing thing.

76
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.400
Adapt and update your project as needed

77
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.053
to achieve the best results.
