<v ->Finishing your work for a project</v>

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.020
is not the same as closing it.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.910
There are still five important steps you need to take

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.330
to successfully hand over a project,

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.880
wrap project activities,

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.610
and protect your company from potential liabilities.

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.360
Follow these five steps to finish a project strong.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.490
Obtaining approvals is the first step

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.990
to closing your project once your work is finished.

10
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.410
Deliver your project to the client or executive management

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.380
for final approval.

12
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.450
All parties must formally recognize

13
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.040
that the project is complete,

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.570
and satisfies agreed upon criteria.

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.740
Keep signatures or written confirmation

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.840
of the project's transfer and acceptance

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.993
for your records.

18
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.520
A quick word of warning:

19
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.230
You cannot continue with the next closing activities

20
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.040
without your client's official sign-off.

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.800
Make any necessary revisions

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.973
before moving on to the next step.

23
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.610
Next, organize and Archive all project documentation.

24
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.100
That includes copies of contracts, financial records,

25
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.290
and project management documents

26
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.440
like the business case, project plan, or schedules.

27
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.670
It also includes project assets

28
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.190
such as templates, media files,

29
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.010
or even a copy of the finished product.

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.870
You may feel like you'll never need these documents again,

31
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.660
but you never know when they may help you

32
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.200
with a similar project in the future.

33
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.530
The third step is to Close finances and contracts.

34
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.790
Review and close all contracts with the project team,

35
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.550
suppliers, or any other vendors.

36
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.670
Complete any outstanding payments,

37
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.223
and finalize any last financial processes or reports.

38
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.440
The fourth step is to Review lessons learned.

39
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.453
This step is often overlooked.

40
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.370
Call your project team together for a final meeting

41
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.520
to discuss how the project went.

42
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.760
Discuss what worked well, what didn't work well,

43
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.440
and how the project or process could be improved.

44
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.940
Document lessons learned,

45
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.680
and review these insights for future projects

46
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.573
to avoid making the same mistakes.

47
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440
The last step is to Release the project's resources.

48
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.520
That means you need to officially disband the project team

49
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.500
so that they can work on other projects

50
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.520
or normal business operations.

51
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.020
It also means returning any equipment or tools

52
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.050
that you no longer need.

53
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.980
Project closure is a crucial step

54
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.450
in the project management process.

55
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500
You don't want to get stuck in a project that never ends,

56
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.840
or find yourself responsible for a project

57
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320
that didn't fulfill it's goals or contract

58
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.690
with outstanding payments.

59
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.700
Turn these five steps into a checklist

60
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.193
that you can review at the end of every project.
